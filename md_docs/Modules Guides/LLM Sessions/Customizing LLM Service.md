Diving into the customization and concurrency aspects of LionAGI sessions, this guide highlights the flexibility of the [[Sessions|session]] object in accommodating various use cases through custom configurations and managing concurrent operations efficiently.

### Customizing Session Behavior

LionAGI's `Session` offers extensive customization options to tailor the behavior of language model (LLM) API calls and manage rate limits effectively.

#### Customizing Services

LionAGI supports multiple services, including `OpenAI` and `OpenRouter`, with additional options in development. These services can be customized to fit specific requirements, such as API key configuration, token encoding, and rate limits.

**Quick Start with Services:**

```python
import lionagi as li

# Using OpenAI service
service_openai = li.Services.OpenAI()

# Or using OpenRouter service
service_openrouter = li.Services.OpenRouter()
```

**Configuring Services:**

You can configure services by specifying parameters like `api_key`, `key_scheme`, and rate limits (`max_tokens`, `max_requests`, `interval`).

#### Modifying LLM Configuration

The `llmconfig` setting allows you to define default model parameters for API calls within a session. This configuration can be set during session creation or updated later.

**Example Configuration:**

```python
llmconfig_ = {
    # Replace with your actual configuration
    'model': 'gpt-4-1106-preview',
    'max_tokens': 100,
    # Additional parameters...
}

# Creating a session with custom llmconfig
session1 = li.Session("you are a helpful assistant", llmconfig=llmconfig_)

# Or updating llmconfig later
session1.default_branch.llmconfig.update(llmconfig_)
```

### Rate-Limited Concurrency

Managing concurrency efficiently is crucial for optimizing performance and adhering to service rate limits. LionAGI sessions can handle concurrent operations, enabling parallel processing of multiple scenarios.

#### Implementing a Conditional Calculator Session

Let's illustrate concurrency with a calculator session example, performing operations based on conditions and then running multiple scenarios in parallel.

**Single Scenario Execution:**

```python
import numpy as np
from timeit import default_timer as timer

system = "You are asked to perform as a calculator. Return only a numeric value."

# Defining instructions based on conditions
instruct1 = "sum the absolute values"
instruct2 = "diff the absolute values"
instruct3 = {"if positive": "times 2", "else": "plus 2"}

# Creating a session and executing steps
calculator = li.Session(system)
# Assume context and instruct are defined based on conditions
step1 = await calculator.chat(instruct, context=context)
step2 = await calculator.chat(instruct3)

# Measuring execution time
```

**Parallel Execution:**

To run multiple scenarios concurrently, use `li.alcall` for asynchronous parallel processing.

```python
# Generating contexts for multiple scenarios
contexts = [f(i) for i in range(num_iterations)]  # Assume f(i) generates context

# Define an async workflow for the calculator
async def calculator_workflow(context):
    calculator = li.Session(system)
    # Execution logic similar to the single scenario
    return (res1, res2)

# Running scenarios in parallel and measuring execution time
outs = await li.alcall(contexts, calculator_workflow)
```

**Customized API Service for Concurrent Calls:**

To share a service across sessions, ensuring consistent rate-limiting, initialize sessions with the same service object.

```python
service = li.Services.OpenAI()

async def calculator_workflow(context):
    calculator = li.Session(system, service=service)
    # Execution logic remains the same
    return (res1, res2)

outs = await li.alcall(contexts, calculator_workflow)
```

### Conclusion

This guide underscores the adaptability and efficiency of LionAGI sessions, demonstrating how customization and concurrent processing capabilities enable sophisticated and scalable conversational AI applications. By fine-tuning services, model parameters, and leveraging parallel execution, developers can achieve optimal performance and precision in their AI-driven interactions.
