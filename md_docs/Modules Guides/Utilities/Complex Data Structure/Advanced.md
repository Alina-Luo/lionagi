## Advanced Operations on Nested Data Structures

As you become more comfortable with basic and intermediate operations within LionAGI, the advanced functionalities unlock new possibilities for working with complex nested data. These operations are particularly useful for dynamic data manipulation, filtering based on custom conditions, and merging diverse data structures.

### Inserting Values with `ninsert`

The `ninsert` function allows for the insertion of values into a nested structure at a specified path. If the path does not exist, it will be created. This functionality is crucial for dynamically building nested structures.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from lionagi import ninsert, to_readable_dict

nested_dict = {}
ninsert(nested_dict, ['a', 'b', 'c'], value=1)
ninsert(nested_dict, ['a', 'b', 'd'], value=2)
ninsert(nested_dict, ['a', 'e'], value=3)
ninsert(nested_dict, ['f'], value=4)
print('Nested structure after insertions:')
print(to_readable_dict(nested_dict))
```

### Filtering Nested Structures with `nfilter`

`nfilter` allows for the application of a filtering condition to a nested structure, enabling the removal of elements that do not meet specific criteria. This function is invaluable for cleaning data or extracting relevant subsets.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from lionagi import nfilter

# Filtering a nested dictionary based on a threshold
nested_dict = {
    "data": {'temperature': 22, 'humidity': 80, 'pressure': 1012}, 
    "threshold": {'temperature': 20, 'humidity': 85, 'pressure': 1000}
}

def condition(item):
    key, value = item
    return value > nested_dict['threshold'][key]

filtered_data = nfilter(nested_dict['data'], condition)
print('Filtered nested dictionary:', filtered_data)
```

### Merging Data Structures with `nmerge`

The `nmerge` function is designed to merge multiple nested structures, such as dictionaries and lists, into a unified structure. It supports various configurations to handle key conflicts and sequence merging strategies.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from lionagi import nmerge

# Merging dictionaries with and without overwriting
dicts_to_merge = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c': 4}]
merged_dict_overwrite = nmerge(dicts_to_merge, dict_update=True)
print('Merged with overwriting:', merged_dict_overwrite)

merged_dict_no_overwrite = nmerge(dicts_to_merge, dict_update=False, dict_sequence=True, sequence_separator='_')
print('Merged without overwriting:', merged_dict_no_overwrite)

# Merging lists with sorting
lists_to_merge = [[3, 1], [4, 2]]
merged_list = nmerge(lists_to_merge, sort_list=True)
print('Merged and sorted list:', merged_list)
```

### Assessing Homogeneity with `is_structure_homogeneous`

Understanding the uniformity of nested structures is critical for deciding how to process them. `is_structure_homogeneous` checks whether a structure is entirely composed of dictionaries or lists, aiding in the application of appropriate processing logic.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from lionagi import is_structure_homogeneous

nested_dict = {'a': [1, 2, {'b': 3}], 'c': {'d': 4}}
is_homogeneous, structure_type = is_structure_homogeneous(nested_dict, return_structure_type=True)
print('Is homogeneous:', is_homogeneous, 'Type:', structure_type)
```

### Conclusion

These advanced operations enhance LionAGI's capability to manipulate and analyze complex nested data structures, providing developers with the tools necessary for sophisticated data processing tasks. By leveraging `ninsert`, `nfilter`, `nmerge`, and assessing structure homogeneity, you can handle a wide range of data manipulation scenarios more effectively.
