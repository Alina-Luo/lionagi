The Schema Class in LionAGI serves as a cornerstone for structuring and managing complex data types, essential for developers working on applications that require meticulous data handling and logging. This class is meticulously designed to accommodate a wide array of data structures, ranging from simple to complex, ensuring data integrity and facilitating easy data manipulation. The Schema Class is divided into several key components, each tailored to specific aspects of data management within LionAGI: `BaseNodes`, `DataLogger`, `DataNode`, and `Structure`. 

### Schema Class Overview

- **[[Base Component]]**: The foundation of LionAGI's schema system, `BaseNodes`, defines the basic elements that constitute the building blocks of more complex data structures. This section delves into the core functionalities and properties of base nodes, outlining how they can be extended and customized to fit various data handling requirements. Understanding `BaseNodes` is crucial for developers aiming to implement custom data structures or modify existing ones to better suit their application's needs.

- **[[API reference/Schema/Data Node|Data Node]]**: An integral component of the Schema Class, the `DataLogger` is designed to facilitate efficient logging, tracking, and retrieval of data throughout the lifecycle of an application. This section covers the mechanisms and methodologies employed by the `DataLogger` to ensure accurate and reliable data logging, making it invaluable for applications that require detailed data auditing, historical data analysis, or real-time data monitoring.

- **[[API reference/Schema/Data Node|Data Node]]**: Building upon the foundation laid by `BaseNodes`, `DataNode` introduces more sophisticated data handling capabilities, allowing for the representation and manipulation of complex data structures within LionAGI applications. This section explores the functionalities provided by `DataNode`, including data validation, transformation, and serialization, highlighting its role in ensuring data consistency and facilitating complex data operations.

- **[[Relationship]]**: The `Relationship` class, extending `BaseRelatableNode`, models connections between nodes in a graph with an emphasis on conditional interactions. It introduces attributes for source and target node identifiers and a dictionary for relationship-specific conditions. Key methods allow adding, removing, checking, and retrieving these conditions, enhancing the framework's ability to represent and manipulate complex relationships within graph-based structures.

- **[[Graph]]**: The `Graph` class, derived from `BaseRelatableNode`, is designed to encapsulate a graph structure comprehensively. It manages nodes and relationships within the graph, providing a robust set of functionalities for graph data manipulation. The class maintains dictionaries for nodes, relationships, and the mappings of node relationships, facilitating the addition, removal, and querying of both nodes and their connections. Through methods like `add_node`, `add_relationship`, `remove_node`, `remove_relationship`, and others, the `Graph` class offers an intuitive interface for managing complex graph topologies, including support for conversions to other graph formats like [NetworkX](https://networkx.org). 

- **[[Structure]]**: The `Structure` component of the Schema Class encapsulates the organization and relationship between different data nodes, providing a comprehensive framework for defining complex data schemas. This section examines how `Structure` enables the creation of nested, interconnected data models, supporting the development of applications that manage intricate data relationships and hierarchies.
