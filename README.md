# LionAGI 

Towards Automated General Intelligence. 



LionAGI is a data centric project for production ready applications that uses AI tools, such as LLM (Large Language Model). 

LionAGI enables powerful and robust intelligent workflow automation

- Fast file manipulation, reading, chunking, binning, saving to tabular format
- Concurrent API calls to OpenAI with custom rate limits for maximum throughput
- Intuitive interaction with LLM for rapid workflow creation

Currently, LionAGI only natively support OpenAI API calls, support for LLM providers as well as open source will be integrated in future releases.  

To install download the file as a zip, then
```python
pip install -e dir_to_unzipped_folder
```
and change the API key in .env_template then rename as .env and put in the root dir of your project. Check the notebook for sample usages
