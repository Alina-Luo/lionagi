       "1. For the first question about the school ordering laptops for its students, the total number of laptops needed is **200**. This was determined by multiplying the number of students per classroom (25) by the total number of classrooms (8), resulting in 200 laptops needed for the school.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The second calculation was intended to find out the number of boxes needed for a party based on the requirement that each of the 48 attendees gets one cupcake, with each box containing 6 cupcakes. However, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in the execution of the task as the calculation repeated the multiplication instead of dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per box to find out how many boxes were needed. The correct approach should have been to divide 48 (the total number of cupcakes needed) by 6 (the number of cupcakes per box). Since the multiplication was done instead, the result given was 48, which reflects a different calculation (multiplying 6 by 8) and does not answer the original question correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "To correct the information for the second question: Given that each box contains 6 cupcakes and the customer needs enough cupcakes for 48 people, the customer needs to buy **8 boxes** of cupcakes (as 48 divided by 6 equals 8). This calculation was implicitly confirmed by the incorrect action but corresponds to the right number of boxes needed based on the total attendees at the party.\n",

       "- The school needs to order **200 laptops** for its students.\n",
