       "The `Session` class is designed to represent a conversation session with a conversational AI system. It orchestrates the flow of the conversation, manages system settings, and interfaces with external tools. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the `Session` class works:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialization**: When a `Session` object is created, it initializes its attributes. This includes creating an instance of the `Conversation` class, which is assigned to the `conversation` attribute. The `system` attribute is set to the current system setting for the conversation, which could define the behavior or configuration of the conversational AI.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Conversation Management**: The `Conversation` instance within the `Session` is responsible for managing the messages that are part of the conversation. This includes storing messages, processing user inputs, and generating responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **System Settings**: The `system` attribute holds information about the current system settings. These settings could affect how the conversation is conducted, such as which language model to use or specific parameters that tailor the conversation's behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **External Interactions**: The `Session` class interacts with external tools and services. This could involve logging data using `DataLogger`, tracking the status of the conversation with `StatusTracker`, or utilizing `ToolManager` to integrate additional functionalities.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Service Communication**: The `Session` may communicate with external services such as `OpenAIService`, which could be an interface to a language model or AI service. This service could be configured using settings from `oai_llmconfig`.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Asynchronous Operations**: The presence of `aiohttp` and `asyncio` in the imports suggests that the `Session` may perform asynchronous HTTP requests, possibly to interact with web-based APIs or services without blocking the execution of the program.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Utility Functions**: The `Session` can use utility functions like `to_list`, `l_call`, and `al_call` from `sys_util`, which might help in list conversion and asynchronous function calling.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **API Utilities**: The `Session` might use `api_util` for tracking the status of API calls, ensuring that the conversation session can handle and report on the status of its interactions with external APIs.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Running the Session**: During the conversation, the `Session` would use its methods to receive input, process it, and provide output. This involves using the `Conversation` instance to handle the back-and-forth of messages.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Ending the Session**: Once the conversation is concluded, the `Session` would perform any necessary cleanup, such as logging the conversation's end, updating the status tracker, and closing any external connections if needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout its lifecycle, the `Session` acts as the central coordinator for the conversational AI, ensuring that all components work together to provide a seamless conversational experience."
