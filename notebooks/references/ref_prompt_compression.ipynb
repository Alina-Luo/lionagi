    "Introduction\n",
    "You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a community-maintained library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "npm install openai@^4.0.0\n",
    "Authentication\n",
    "API keys\n",
    "The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. You can create API keys at a user or service account level. Service accounts are tied to a \"bot\" individual and should be used to provision access for production systems. Each API key can be scoped to one of the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "Project keys - Provides access to a single project (preferred option); access Project API keys by selecting the specific project you wish to generate keys against.\n",
    "User keys - Our legacy keys. Provides access to all organizations and all projects that user has been added to; access API Keys to view your available keys. We highly advise transitioning to project keys for best security practices, although access via this method is currently still supported.\n",
    "Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.\n",
    "\n",
    "All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "Organizations and projects (optional)\n",
    "For users who belong to multiple organizations or are accessing their projects through their legacy user API key, you can pass a header to specify which organization and project is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization and project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the Default project in an organization, leave out the OpenAI-Project header\n",
    "\n",
    "Example curl command:\n",
    "\n",
    "curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \\\n",
    "  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n",
    "  -H \"OpenAI-Organization: org-rU9EfyXF6LGImfhnZE2D0VrJ\" \\\n",
    "  -H \"OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID\"\n",

    "  organization='org-rU9EfyXF6LGImfhnZE2D0VrJ',\n",
    "  project='$PROJECT_ID',\n",

    "});\n",
    "Organization IDs can be found on your Organization settings page. Project IDs can be found on your General settings page by selecting the specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making requests\n",
    "You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your secret API key. If you are using a legacy user key and you have multiple projects, you will also need to specify the Project Id. For improved security, we recommend transitioning to project based keys instead.\n",

    "\n",
    "Streaming\n",
    "The OpenAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the Server-sent events standard. Our official Node and Python libraries include helpers to make parsing these events simpler.\n",

    "Streaming is supported for both the Chat Completions API and the Assistants API. This section focuses on how streaming works for Chat Completions. Learn more about how streaming works in the Assistants API here.\n",

    "\n",

    "        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n",
    "In Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:\n",
